## OBJECTIVE : TO BE FAMILIAR WITH FLOW LAYOUT AND POSITIONED LAYOUT IN CSS.  
  
## THEORY:  
  
1.  CSS FLOW LAYOUT :
  Flow layout or Normal Flow , is the way that Block and inline elements are isplayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

    
2. CSS Positioned Layout is a module of CSS that defines how to position elements on the page.

     Properties : 
       - top
       - right
       - bottom
       - left
       - z-index

3. Z-INDEX:
 The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.  

 * An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
 * z-index only works on positioned elements(position : absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky)

## CONCLUSION: 
 Hence , we learn't to make use of Flow layout and Positioned Layout in CSS...
